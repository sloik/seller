# Alle Seller

This is the hosting app for the Alle Seller project. It's main purpose is to host the main app (Seller).

This can also be used for UI test and as a place that is used to inject dependencies.

At the moement other modules explicitly state tair dependecies. In the future they could only define thos as protocols. Then `App` module will integrate any 3rd party depcnecies and inject them into other modules.
